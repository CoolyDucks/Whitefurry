# Whitefurry 🐾

Whitefurry is a simple and lightweight conversational AI project written in Python.

The goal of Whitefurry is to provide a clear and minimal example of how an AI assistant can understand basic English input, detect user intent, and respond in a natural way.

Whitefurry is designed to be easy to read, easy to run, and easy to extend.
